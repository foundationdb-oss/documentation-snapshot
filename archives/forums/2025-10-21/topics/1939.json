        "cooked": "<p>Windows was always an officially supported OS. However, Windows support comes at a great cost and I am not convinced that we currently are paying the cost. Therefore I would like to propose that we drop support for the Microsoft Compiler (MSVC).</p>\n<p>To the best of my understanding FDB on Windows is pretty much untested. Just having a badly tested binary on the official download page is not very responsible. We also never look at compiler warnings on Windows, so even the theoretical benefit of having the code verified by another compiler toolchain is not that big of a benefit. But having a compiler and standard library with a potentially significantly different behavior seems risky.</p>\n<p>I think the main reason we still officially support Windows (badly) is because people are generally afraid to cut features (and sometimes for good reasons).</p>\n<p>I understand there\u2019s value in being able to run FDB on Windows (mostly for development - I don\u2019t think I would trust it enough to actually run a production system on Windows).</p>\n<p>I wanted to know what others think? To be clear: I don\u2019t think we should drop Windows support. However, I don\u2019t think we should continue to compile with MSVC and instead find alternatives (they are ordered by amount of work it takes to make it happen).</p>\n<h1>Alternative One: Docker</h1>\n<p>This would be the easiest solution and probably also works: <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment?tabs=Windows-Server\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment?tabs=Windows-Server</a></p>\n<p>The main drawback is that this is virtualization. However, I would not be surprised if FDB in a VM is faster than FDB natively running on Windows. In fact I would be surprised if that wouldn\u2019t be the case (I don\u2019t believe we regularly run benchmarks on Windows).</p>\n<h2>Pros:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Probably very limited amount of work - this should already be possible</li>\n<li>Probably the most robust solution - most of the testing is done on Linux and this will probably have the lowest number of changes compared to test and production systems out there.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Cons:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>High setup cost: for an application developer who want to build an application on top of FDB, setting up docker might be a high cost.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Alternative Two:  WSL</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-index\">Linux subsystem for Windows</a> can run Linux applications natively on Windows. This has more or less the same pros and cons to using Docker.</p>\n<h1>Alternative Three: Use Clang</h1>\n<p>Clang can build native Windows applications and is officially supported by Microsoft (you can even download it as part of Visual Studio).</p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We would use a tested toolchain. This would at least mitigate the risk that a different compiler would introduce new bugs or that the standard library would behave drastically differently</li>\n<li>We could still ship a normal Windows installer.</li>\n<li>This could potentially perform well - and maybe even better than a virtualized solution.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Everything in <code>Platform.cpp</code> would still be different - including the <code>IAsyncFile</code> implementation - so there will still be need for proper testing.</li>\n<li>We would still need to maintain a Windows build</li>\n</ol>",

        "cooked": "<p>Hi Markus,</p>\n<p>This is not great news for Apache CouchDB.</p>\n<p>Part of our selection criteria for moving to a FDB backend was proper Windows support. There is a large (though not primary) user base presently using CouchDB in desktop settings on MacOS and Windows. These are small office / home office type applications where clustering isn\u2019t useful. We also have a few (large) client using CouchDB on Windows for actual clustered servers (though we would generally counsel them to use Linux/BSD instead.)</p>\n<p>Alternatives 1 and 2 are no-gos for these environments, I\u2019m afraid. We\u2019ve been down this path with them before and both have been summarily rejected for the time being. (The reasons are largely administrative, political and legal, and less technical.)</p>\n<p>For CouchDB, should either of these alternatives be selected, we might have to drop plans to use FDB on all platforms, and build against something like SQLite on Windows instead. At the very least, that would delay our full FDB-based release by some time. It also wouldn\u2019t help for the Windows-based clustered installations, which would no longer be possible.</p>\n<p>Alternative 3 is probably fine for us, though our experience with CouchDB packaging and building its toolchain and dependencies (Erlang, ICU, curl, OpenSSL, Mozilla Spidermonkey) are that MSVC builds are both more performant and more broadly compatible with other native Windows applications. What will matter is that our native FDB driver in Erlang still be compile-able with MSVC, which it should be. (FYI, cross-linking of separately built MSVC and MinGW-built binaries is frequently not possible \u2013 see <a href=\"https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/master/HOWTO/INSTALL-WIN32.md\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Erlang\u2019s Win32 build walkthrough</a> for a partial explanation.)</p>\n<p>Could you provide more detail as to why Clang is preferred over MSVC? If it\u2019s just cli options, there are wrappers extant to make <code>cl.exe</code> and <code>link.exe</code> act more like <code>gcc/g++</code> and <code>ld</code>. If it\u2019s MSBuild vs. GNU make, you can absolutely use <code>make</code> with MSVC, that\u2019s how we build CouchDB today.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m happy to share my experience in comparing and contrasting both compiler chains, and possibly help find workarounds, though my time for contribution is limited.</p>\n<p>For reference, in case you\u2019re looking at your download numbers for Windows to inform this decision, CouchDB right now are wrapping our 3.0 release (the last major release before moving to FDB). We were planning to start exploring FDB on Windows with CouchDB in the next couple of months; it\u2019s not been the focus to date.</p>",

One is that if your code compiles on Linux or MacOS you will have a higher confidence that it will also compile on Windows (I broke the windows build several times before). The same is true for building behavior. Sure you can use <code>make</code> instead of <code>msbuild</code> build but the behavior is still wildly different. One example is that MSVC implements parallel builds very different from clang and gcc (as in: clang and gcc don\u2019t implement it while MSVC does - which is very confusing if you have to maintain a build system).</p>\n<p>But the strongest argument for me is actually correctness:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The standard library is different (we have to support libstdc++, libc++, and whatever the MSVC thing is called). Some things are different between those and we might rely on some libstdc++/libc++ specific behavior (for example when it comes to destructor call ordering within containers for which the standard doesn\u2019t define anything but most implementations will give you something deterministic).</li>\n<li>Compilers generate very different code and have very different behavior (for example when it comes to things like memory alignment). gcc and clang very close to each other but MSVC is not. So if we rely on gcc behavior somewhere we might very well have a Windows bug (but not a Linux/MacOS bug).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So having MSVC means that our testing surface increases dramatically. Snowflake is certainly not going to make big investments into Windows (and I assume Apple isn\u2019t either - but I don\u2019t know).</p>\n<p>So for 7.0 nothing will change anyways. However, I created <a href=\"https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/issues/2666\">this Ticket</a>. I will try to find some time to see how hard it would be to compile with clang on Windows. I could then give a binary to you guys and you can evaluate this.</p>\n<p>Also: if you\u2019re going to rely on a Windows build, are you planning to invest anything in that area? Because if you are willing to invest some time in maintaining and testing Windows, my opinion would shift drastically.</p>",

Just having a badly tested binary on the official download page is not very responsible. We also never look at compiler warnings on Windows, so even the theoretical benefit of having the code verified by another compiler toolchain is not that big of a benefit. But having a compiler and standard library with a potentially significantly different behavior seems risky.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>We\u2019ve been running FoundationDB clusters on mostly Windows platforms (desktop for dev, server for \u201cproduction\u201d) for about 5 years, and except a few minor bugs in the early years, the only issues we\u2019ve had were hardware failures. If there are compiler warnings, they don\u2019t seem to hurt that much.</p>\n<p>Up until now, the main component we really 100% need running on Windows is the client. All the recent deployments in production were application servers running on Windows 2016/2019 Server, that talked to an fdb cluster running on Linux (either ubuntu or RHEL). Though it is very handy to have also the server running on Windows for development, training/proof of concept with a single VM running on a laptop, or on CI build VMs that target the .NET Framework (which is still windows only).</p>\n<p>Regarding performance\u2026 not much to say about it. It is true that the Linux implementation is a bit faster,  but the performance of a Windows client to Linux cluster is still orders of magnitudes faster than what we need.</p>\n<p>Regarding virtualization, running on Hyper-V, there is an issue with Dynamic Memory which is not understood by the fdbserver process, so we have to use a fixed amount of ram for these VM, nothing too hard to solve.</p>\n<p>The .NET/C# binding already has support for .NET Core 3.1 and I\u2019m keeping support for .NET Framework, until .NET 5 comes along (which is supposed to \u201cunify\u201d the desktop-only windows world with the .NET core \u201cruns everywhere\u201d world).</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve never used the other bindings (java, python, go, \u2026) on Windows itself, so I can\u2019t say much about that aspect, but if they call the same C API that I do, I don\u2019t think that would change anything.</p>\n<p>Regarding MSVC/VS support, I\u2019ve only occasionally had to try to build fdb on Visual Studio, so I\u2019m not particularly attached to it. Being able to build the windows version to produce win64 binaries where I just need to run some command is fine by me.</p>\n<p>I think if you try to use Visual Studio Code as the IDE, and any build system you want, it would be still a decent development experience on Windows.</p>",

Visual Studio Code currently doesn\u2019t work well on Windows because <code>cmake</code> doesn\u2019t support C# for non-MSBuild builds (and VS Code uses Ninja) - on other platforms we use <code>mono</code> so there this is less of an issue.
