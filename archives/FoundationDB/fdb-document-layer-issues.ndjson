{"active_lock_reason":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"MongoDB mandates on having `_id` as the primary key. It is possible to store any unique keys of the document as `_id` to get primary index on it. But, if we need a composite key as our primary index key, the following are the options\r\n\r\n* Use composite key as an object and `_id` would store the object\r\n  * For example, `{ _id: {a: \"hello\", b: \"world\"}`. This scheme allows queries with predicates with both `a` and `b` present. But, we can't do queries on `a` alone. Also, range queries are not possible\r\n* Key using `ObjectID` for `_id` and create a compound index on the composite key.\r\n  * This scheme helps with range queries. But, it would be bad for performance as a query on the index would need two hops to get the actual document. And the primary index is a waste as we would never use it directly, only through secondary indexes.\r\n* Serialize the composite key manually and provide serialized bytes as `_id` value.\r\n  * This solves all the problems. But, it could get a bit messy on application end, not just for inserts also for queries. Its pretty much what FDB Tuple do.\r\n* Shard keys - This is probably the best way to use composite keys in MongoDB, but it would only work with sharded clusters.

Thus we want a new metric plugin that is more familiar to the community. Prometheus has picked up a lot of momentum during recent years so we would go with that.\r\n\r\nThanks to the design, providing a new metric reporting plugin is easy: \r\n\r\n1. First either write your own cpp Prometheus client code, or use the semi-official one [here](https://github.com/jupp0r/prometheus-cpp). \u003csup\u003e§\u003c/sup\u003e\r\n1. Then simply wrap the client code around the [IMetric](https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-document-layer/blob/master/src/IMetric.h#L37) interface.\r\n1. Finally, when start up the `DocLayer` process, tell it to load the plugin library by passing in the `--metric_plugin` and `--metric_plugin_config` arguments.\r\n\r\nWe think this will benefit the community in many ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003csup\u003e§\u003c/sup\u003e When using/creating the client code, keep in mind that DocLayer is written in `Flow`, whose model has only one process and one thread running on a giant event loop.

This function creates a new collection in case the collection is not already present. Also, the collection context is cached for the sake of performance. When a new collection is created, it's not immediately inserted into the cache, as it is possible transaction might fail. Next request would insert into the cache.\r\n\r\nRace condition happens with following steps\r\n\r\n* A write request on an empty collection creates a new collection in the transaction context but does not insert into the cache\r\n* If the request takes too long and non-isolated, NonIsolatedPlan splits the transaction and commits the transaction, which persists new collection metadata\r\n* Later before creating new transaction it checks the metadata is still valid, while checking due to the nature of `assembleCollectionContext()`, it creates new context again. And obviously, it doesn't match the old context that was created. Hence the issue.\r\n\r\nCouple of things we need to do for this issue\r\n\r\n- [ ] Change `assembleCollectionContext()` to only create new collection, only if asked\r\n- [ ] Only insert and upserts should create new collection","closed_at":"2019-02-21T21:46:09Z","closed_by":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4325397?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apkar/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apkar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apkar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apkar/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/apkar","id":4325397,"login":"apkar","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjUzOTc=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apkar/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apkar/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apkar/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apkar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apkar/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apkar","user_view_type":"public"},"comments":2,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FoundationDB/fdb-document-layer/issues/51/comments","created_at":"2019-01-28T22:31:00Z","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FoundationDB/fdb-document-layer/issues/51/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-document-layer/issues/51","id":404036858,"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"total_blocking":0},"labels":[{"color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":"Something
