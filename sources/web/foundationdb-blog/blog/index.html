It is one of the first systems to combine the flexibility and scalability of NoSQL architectures with the power of ACID transactions (a.k.a. NewSQL). FoundationDB adopts an unbundled architecture that decouples an in-memory transaction management system, a distributed storage system, and a built-in distributed configuration system. Each sub-system can be independently provisioned and configured to achieve the desired scalability, high-availability and fault tolerance properties. FoundationDB uniquely integrates a deterministic simulation framework, used to test every new feature of the system under a myriad of possible faults. This rigorous testing makes FoundationDB extremely stable and allows developers to introduce and release new features in a rapid cadence. FoundationDB offers a minimal and carefully chosen feature set, which has enabled a range of disparate systems (from semi-relational databases, document and object stores, to graph databases and more) to be built as layers on top. FoundationDB is the underpinning of cloud infrastructure at Apple, Snowflake and other companies, due to its consistency, robustness and availability for storing user data, system metadata and configuration, and other critical information.</p><p>The annual <a href="https://2021.sigmod.org/">ACM SIGMOD/PODS conference</a> is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. SIGMOD'21 will be in an online format this year, so all may easily attend.</p><p>Other publications serve as reference for how to leverage FoundationDB as a solution to large-scale data infrastructure problems: <a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/files/record-layer-paper.pdf">FoundationDB Record Layer: A Multi-Tenant Structured Datastore (SIGMOD ’19)</a> presents a record-oriented data model and query language on top of FoundationDB. <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p540-shraer.pdf">CloudKit: Structured Storage for Mobile Applications (VLDB ’18)</a> is a service used at scale, world wide, that uses FoundationDB and the Record Layer; the Record Layer paper describes some of the advantages CloudKit reaps from using FoundationDB.

The 6.1 release dramatically increases the performance of the system during region failures, allowing clusters to keep up with their existing workloads.</li><li><strong>Robust forced recoveries</strong>: If all the transaction logs are lost when a region fails, the system will wait for those transaction logs to come back before recovering to ensure the database remains consistent. However, in the worst case that those transaction logs are lost permanently, the 6.1 release adds a way to force the system to recover to the other region.</li></ul><p>Some other highlights from this release include:</p><ul><li><strong>Batch priority transactions</strong>: Added the ability to execute transactions at batch priority. These transactions do not execute if the cluster is too busy to handle them. This feature makes it safer and easier to bulk insert data into a production cluster.</li><li><strong>Efficient consistent caching</strong>: Added a special key whose value is sent to clients at the beginning of every transaction. Clients can know that locally cached metadata is still valid as long as the value of this key has not changed.</li></ul><p>A full list of features, fixes, and other changes are documented in our <a href="https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/release-notes.html">release notes</a>.</p></p></div><div class="blog-sample-card"><h1 class="blog-sample-link"><a href="foundationdb-one-year-later/index.html">FoundationDB, One Year Later</a></h1><span class="published-date">Published April 19, 2019</span><p><p>Happy birthday, FoundationDB!

Layers extend the functionality of the database by adding features and data models to allow new storage access patterns. Today we are releasing the <a href="https://www.github.com/foundationdb/fdb-record-layer/">FoundationDB Record Layer</a>, which provides relational database semantics on top of FoundationDB. This layer features schema management, indexing facilities, and a rich set of query capabilities. The Record Layer is used in production at Apple to support applications and services for hundreds of millions of users.</p><h2 id="a-record-oriented-database-on-top-of-foundationdb">A record-oriented database on top of FoundationDB</h2><p>The Record Layer stores structured data, just like a relational database. Databases managed by the Record Layer support records with fields and types, an evolving schema, complex primary and secondary indexes, and declarative query execution. The Record Layer also includes features not typically found in a traditional relational database, such as support for complex nested data types, indexes on the commit-time of records, and indexes and queries that span different types of records.</p><p>Built on top of FoundationDB, the Record Layer inherits FoundationDB's strong ACID semantics, reliability, and performance in a distributed setting. The Record Layer also uses FoundationDB's transactional semantics to provide features similar to a traditional relational database, but in a distributed setting. For example, the Record Layer's secondary indexes are maintained transactionally, so they're always up-to-date with the latest changes to the data. Transactions reduce the number of bugs in application code and greatly simplify application development.</p><h2 id="built-for-scale">Built for Scale</h2><p>The Record Layer is built for a massive scale, allowing millions of discrete database instances to be managed within a single FoundationDB cluster. Its design and core feature set were built to scale to many millions of concurrent users and a diverse ecosystem of client applications each with unique data models and query access patterns.</p><p>To make operations simple, the Record Layer is stateless, so scaling up is as simple as launching more instances. It's also built from the ground up for massive multi-tenancy, encapsulating and isolating all of a tenant's state. The Record Layer can also tightly constrain and balance resource consumption across users in a predictable fashion, even in the face of a wide variety of workloads and activity. Together, these properties enable the Record Layer to scale elastically as the demands of its clients grow.</p><p>Together, the Record Layer and FoundationDB form the backbone of Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/">CloudKit</a>. We wrote a paper describing how we built the Record Layer to run at massive scale and how CloudKit uses it. Today, you can <a href="https://www.foundationdb.org/files/record-layer-paper.pdf">read the ~~preprint~~ SIGMOD'19</a> to learn more.</p><h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2><p>There's a lot more to say about the Record Layer. At a very high level, the Record Layer:</p><ul><li>Represents records as Protocol Buffer messages, providing industry-standard serialization and schema evolution. Features such as nested and repeated fields have first-class support.</li><li>Supports transactional secondary indexing that takes full advantage of the Protocol Buffer data model. We have a variety of advanced index types, including aggregate indexes such as grouped counts, full text indexes, ordinal rank indexes, and extensible functional indexes. Where possible, our implementations leverage advanced FoundationDB features, such as atomic mutations.</li><li>Includes a declarative query API for retrieving data and a query planner for turning those queries into concrete database operations.</li><li>Operates in a completely stateless manner. Instantiating a logical database and performing an operation can be done in milliseconds. Resource constraints allow any given operation or query to be limited. Continuations allow control to be handed back to the client to allow them to iteratively make progress in concert with all other clients.</li><li>Provides a large number of deep extension points. For example, users can build custom index maintainers and query planning features to seamlessly “plug-in” new index types. Similarly, the layer's serialization API supports client-defined encryption and compression algorithms.</li></ul><p>All of this leverages the full breadth and power of FoundationDB functionality, including strong ACID semantics and advanced features such as controllable isolation levels.</p><h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2><p>The <a href="https://foundationdb.github.io/fdb-record-layer/GettingStarted.html">getting started guide</a> will walk you through creating a simple application that uses the Record Layer.

The Document Layer is a stateless server, backed by the scalable and transactional features of FoundationDB.</p><p>Released under an Apache v2 license, the Document Layer project is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-document-layer">GitHub</a>. See the project documentation to get started, and we encourage your participation on the <a href="https://forums.foundationdb.org/c/document-layer">new forum section for the Document Layer</a>.</p><h2 id="mongodb-api-compatible">MongoDB® API Compatible</h2><p>For developers looking to use FoundationDB, the Document Layer has a familiar API, and is compatible with the MongoDB® protocol. In fact, simple applications leveraging MongoDB® can have a lift-and-shift migration to the Document Layer.</p><p>If you want to connect your application to the Document Layer, you can use any existing MongoDB® client — making it easy to get started. A discussion of the features supported by Document Layer can be found in <a href="https://foundationdb.github.io/fdb-document-layer/">the project's documentation</a>.</p><h2 id="scalable-document-storage-with-foundationdb">Scalable Document Storage with FoundationDB</h2><p>By extending FoundationDB, the Document Layer inherits key qualities of the core project — including years of testing, support for ACID transactions, and great performance. Using FoundationDB as a base for this stateless layer lets the Document Layer innovate in a number of notable ways.</p><ul><li>No write locks: write operations, even on a single document, do not take locks. Transactions in FoundationDB are optimistic (lockless) and, by storing a document as multiple key-value pairs, the Document Layer supports many parallel writers. In some cases, operations may have to retry due to conflicts; however, non-conflicting operations, including metadata operations, can proceed in parallel.</li><li>No sharding: The Document Layer does not rely on a fixed shard key to distribute data. Instead, all data partitioning and rebalancing is managed automatically by the key-value store. This design, directly inherited from FoundationDB, provides robust horizontal scalability while avoiding client-level complexity.</li><li>Easy scaling: Each running instance of the Document Layer is a stateless application, configured only with the FoundationDB cluster to which it stores data. This stateless design means that many instances of Document Layer can be put behind a load balancer, all able to handle queries from any client and for any document.</li><li>Safe defaults: By default, write operations on the Document Layer execute with full isolation and atomicity. This consistency makes it easier to correctly implement applications that handle more than one simultaneous request. Indexes are always consistent with document data. Writes are fully consistent all the time irrespective of client selected options and, similarly, reads always see strong causal consistency.</li></ul><p>Please see the documentation for more info about <a href="https://foundationdb.github.io/fdb-document-layer/architecture.html">the architecture of the Document Layer</a>.</p><h2 id="the-future-is-layers">The Future is Layers</h2><p>When we first released FoundationDB we wrote in <a href="foundationdb-is-open-source/index.html">the original announcement</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The vision of FoundationDB is to start with a simple, powerful core and extend it through the addition of “layers”. The key-value store, which is open sourced today, is the core, focused on incorporating only features that aren’t possible to write in layers. Layers extend that core by adding features to model specific types of data and handle their access patterns.</p></blockquote><p>The FoundationDB key-value store is powerful but, as noted above, its features remain narrowly scoped to distributed transactions and stateful storage. The Document Layer takes the key-value store's focused API and uses it to model a much more complex style of data storage. Because the Document Layer exposes a new, general-purpose API we think of this as an extension to FoundationDB.</p><p>The key-value store of FoundationDB lacks a number of features you would expect of a full database system. For instance there are no indexes, no data typing, and no query engine. The Document Layer extends FoundationDB to add a number of such concepts. Take index maintenance: key-value store transactions are used to simultaneously update both a document's field and an index value that points back at the field. This is <a href="https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/simple-indexes.html">a common pattern</a> for how simple indexes can be built. As an extension to FoundationDB, Document Layer makes this pattern available to clients in a robust and reusable manner.</p><p>We could not be more excited to have the Document Layer as a community project! We're excited to see where we can take this together. Community collaboration does not need to end with the document model either — many other layers could be generally useful, written either as a library or a network server. The Document Layer should serve as a template for future layers both in design and in utility.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: MongoDB is a registered trademark of MongoDB, Inc..</em></p></p></div><div class="blog-sample-card"><h1 class="blog-sample-link"><a href="foundationdb-6-0-15-released/index.html">FoundationDB 6.0.15 Released</a></h1><span class="published-date">Published November 19, 2018</span><p><p>FoundationDB 6.0.15, our first major release since open sourcing FoundationDB in April, is now officially available!</p><p>The latest FoundationDB release can be downloaded and installed as binaries from <a href="https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases/tag/6.0.15">GitHub</a> (available for macOS, Windows, Linux), or as source from our <a href="https://github.com/apple/foundationdb">GitHub repository</a>. If you're already running FDB, also see our <a href="https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/administration.html#upgrading-foundationdb">upgrade instructions</a>.</p><p>The FoundationDB 6.0 series features an architectural shift in the approach to cross-region replication, improving how FoundationDB can be managed as a production system. Among the key improvements:</p><ul><li>New multi-region support within single clusters</li><li>TLS improved for operational flexibility</li><li>Faster failure recovery in a number of situations</li></ul><p>A full list of features, fixes, and other changes are documented in our <a href="https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/release-notes.html">release notes</a>.</p><h2 id="new-multi-region-support-and-seamless-failover">New multi-region support and seamless failover</h2><p>FoundationDB 6.0 introduces native multi-region support to dramatically increase your database's global availability. Seamless failover between regions is now possible, allowing your cluster to survive the near-simultaneous loss of an entire region with no service interruption. These features can be deployed so clients experience low-latency, single-region writes.</p><p>FoundationDB now has the flexibility to run in either multiple or single regions, offering greater control over how failover scenarios are managed. If you choose a multi-region configuration, one region will operate as the write authority by default. If an availability zone were to experience an outage, FoundationDB would automatically transfer authority to the other region without any data loss. Alternatively, if you choose to run FoundationDB in a single region, a FoundationDB cluster can now be configured to intelligently make use of multiple AZs for tolerance of an instant loss of an AZ.</p><p>These features were made possible by adding several new concepts to FoundationDB:</p><ul><li><strong>Region locality:</strong> When FoundationDB stores data to a disk, whether on a storage server or transaction log, it now has awareness of the region the disk is in. Locality information makes new features within FoundationDB possible, including the ability to prioritize process responsibilities so that region-local operations are always preferred.</li><li><strong>Bandwidth-conserving replication:</strong> New functionality conserves bandwidth when replicating data over expensive, high-latency intra-region links. This replication strategy sends a single copy of data between regions and then redistributes the data to replicas on the remote side.</li><li><strong>Region failure modes:</strong> The addition of multi-region support led us to rethink our response to failures across the codebase. FoundationDB has always been robust against machine failures and assumed these failures to be permanent. The response to a failure was to immediately copy data onto other machines. Region or AZ failures are, however, temporary and expensive to recover from, since copying the entire database's contents over the WAN is expensive.</li></ul><p>These architectural changes open up a host of possibilities for future replication configurations and datacenter layouts. To learn more about configuring region settings, please check out the <a href="https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/configuration.html#configuration-configuring-regions">updated documentation</a> and discuss these changes further on the <a href="https://forums.foundationdb.org/">FoundationDB forums</a>.</p><h2 id="thanks-to-our-contributors">Thanks to our contributors</h2><p>Thanks to those who contributed to the 6.0 series: A.J.

Thank you to all who have installed FoundationDB, contributed, and engaged in our community.</p><p>Coinciding with the release announcement, several long-time adopters have also blogged about their experiences with the project, including Wavefront and Snowflake:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.wavefront.com/wavefront-foundationdb-open-source-project/">Wavefront by VMware’s Ongoing Commitment to the FoundationDB Open Source Project</a></li><li><a href="https://www.snowflake.net/how-foundationdb-powers-snowflake-metadata-forward/">How FoundationDB Powers Snowflake Metadata Forward</a></li></ul><p>We believe in, and want to build a strong community to help support and develop the project. We're thrilled by this early participation.</p><h2 id="early-activity-in-the-ecosystem">Early activity in the ecosystem</h2><p>FoundationDB is a multi-model system, enabling different layers to extend the core key-value store for different uses. One of the things we're most excited to see is development outside of the core, with the community extending the project in new ways.</p><p>Since the initial open source release, we've seen several community-driven projects emerge. Here are a few worth checking out:</p><p><strong>Layers:</strong></p><ul><li>JanusGraph is a distributed graph database. The development of a storage adapter enables it to be used with FoundationDB. See the <a href="https://forums.foundationdb.org/t/janusgraph-foundationdb-storage-adapter/286">forum post</a> for more info.</li><li>Two projects to implement a network block device, one <a href="https://github.com/dividuum/fdb-nbd">in Python</a>, the other <a href="https://github.com/spullara/nbd">in Java</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Language bindings:</strong></p><ul><li>Node.JS <a href="https://github.com/josephg/node-foundationdb">https://github.com/josephg/node-foundationdb</a></li><li>PHP <a href="https://github.com/viest/PHP-FoundationDB">https://github.com/viest/PHP-FoundationDB</a></li><li>C# / .NET bindings <a href="https://github.com/Doxense/foundationdb-dotnet-client">https://github.com/Doxense/foundationdb-dotnet-client</a></li><li>Haskell <a href="https://github.com/thumphries/foundationdb">https://github.com/thumphries/foundation</a></li></ul><p>This is only the beginning, and we can't wait to see what you build with FoundationDB!

These clusters scale well as you add machines, automatically heal from hardware failures, and have a simple API. The key-value store supports fully global, cross-row ACID transactions. That's the highest level of data consistency possible. What does this mean for you? Strong consistency makes your application code simpler, your data models more efficient, and your failure modes less surprising.</p><p>The great thing is that FoundationDB is already well-established — it's actively developed and has years of production use. We intend to drive FoundationDB forward as a community project and we welcome your participation.</p><h2 id="a-powerful-abstraction">A powerful abstraction</h2><p>We believe FoundationDB can become the foundation of the next generation of distributed databases. Since its beginnings in 2010 as a startup, the world of databases has increasingly aligned with FoundationDB to favor data consistency.</p><p>The vision of FoundationDB is to start with a simple, powerful core and extend it through the addition of “layers”. The key-value store, which is open sourced today, is the core, focused on incorporating only features that aren’t possible to write in layers. Layers extend that core by adding features to model specific types of data and handle their access patterns.</p><p>The fundamental architecture of FoundationDB, including its use of layers, promotes the best practices of scalable and manageable systems. By running multiple layers on a single cluster (for example a document store layer and a graph layer), you can match your specific applications to the best data model. Running less infrastructure reduces your organization's operational and technical overhead.</p><p>By open sourcing the FoundationDB core, we expect the quantity and variety of layers to develop rapidly. When we think about the FoundationDB community, we approach it both in terms of the core itself and the ecosystem of layers that it enables.</p><h2 id="building-an-open-community">Building an Open Community</h2><p>By open sourcing FoundationDB, our goal is to build an open community. All major development will be done in the open. We’ve outlined a design document process to ensure that this work is done transparently and with community input. We’ve taken early steps to outline project governance to provide a basic structure that will enable members of the community who actively contribute to have a greater voice in the project decision-making.</p><p>We also want FoundationDB to be a healthy and responsive community. To that end, we’ve adopted a code of conduct based on the Contributor Covenant to outline the behaviors we encourage and those we disallow.</p><p>We’d love your participation. Here are several ways you can get involved:</p><ul><li>Ask questions on the FoundationDB community forums: <a href="https://forums.foundationdb.org/">forums.foundationdb.org</a>.
