FoundationDB and Node.js: Year in Production - Steve Korshakov, OpenlandÂ 

About a year ago we moved all our stack to FoundationDB, in the last year we have built a multi-functional library (http://fdb.openland.com) to work with FDB in NodeJS that can: Distributed Locks, Work Queue, Entity Layer (very similar to Record Layer), Distributed Random ID generator, Singleton Workers and so on. I want to share my experience using FDB in production for building a messaging app and sharing this library to the community.
