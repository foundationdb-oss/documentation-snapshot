Speaker: Paymaan Raza, Software Engineer, Apple

Speaker Bio: Paymaan is a software engineer at Apple, where he works on FoundationDB. With a deep interest in databases and infrastructure, he enjoys tackling hard problems from first principles to build simple, scalable, and useful systems. Prior to Apple, he developed a core streaming platform for Meta's control plane and engineered key data infrastructure components at LinkedIn, gaining extensive experience in crafting reliable solutions for large-scale distributed environments.

Talk Summary: Gray failures in FoundationDB are subtle performance degradations that, while not full crashes, impact system health and burden operators with manual intervention. This talk presents a simple yet effective self-healing mechanism designed to address such issues. We'll demonstrate how we reused FoundationDB's core architectural building blocks—such as unbundled roles, central Cluster Controller, transport layer latency metrics, and fast recovery—to implement a "complaining" algorithm where processes report slow peers, enabling automated detection and remediation, thereby significantly improving FoundationDB's resilience and reducing operational load.
