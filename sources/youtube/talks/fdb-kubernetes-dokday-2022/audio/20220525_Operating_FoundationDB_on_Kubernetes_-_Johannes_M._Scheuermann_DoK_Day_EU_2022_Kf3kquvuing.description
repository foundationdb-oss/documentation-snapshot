From the DoK Day EU 2022 (https://youtu.be/Xi-h4XNd5tE)

FoundationDB is an open-source distributed transactional Key-Value store that is used by multiple companies like Apple, Snowflake and VMWare Tanzu (previously Wavefront).

This talk will cover the design of the FoundationDB operator and lessons learned from operating FoundationDB on Kubernetes. We will discuss some of the missing pieces in Kubernetes to make it easier to operate FoundationDB on top of it and how we solved those challenges in the operator. We will focus on the pieces of the FoundationDB operator that are different to most other operators and why we decided to implement those pieces like they are. We will also discuss how to run an high available FoundationDB cluster on top of Kubernetes and what different choices a user has. We will also cover some challenges that arise when running stateful services at scale on top of Kubernetes and how they can be managed. At the end of this talk we will give an outlook for future design changes and planned features in our operator.

The main take-away from this talk is to understand how to run and operate FoundationDB on Kubernetes.
