New Snowflake Capabilities and What They Mean for FoundationDB - Torsten Grabs, Snowflake 

Snowflake as a cloud-built data warehouse heavily relies on FoundationDB for metadata management. In this talk, we will explore some of Snowflake's newest capabilities such as database replication, data sharing, data pipelines and data lake integration. Their implementation presents us with interesting challenges, both for metadata management in FoundationDB and for elastic and scalable cloud data processing in general. We will discuss how we have tackled these challenges in Snowflake and where we see additional work in FoundationDB and beyond.
