JanusGraph is a popular open source property graph database that serves a variety of transactional and analytical use cases. It was originally designed to run on top of a number of different distributed storage engines including Apache Cassandra and Apache HBase. This talk will discuss the new JanusGraph FoundationDB storage adapter which adds distributed ACID support to JanusGraph. Topics will include an intro to JanusGraph and FoundationDB layer development followed by a deep dive into how the property graph model and read/write access patterns have been mapped on to FoundationDB. We will also discuss how FoundationDB's unique features  address a number of JanusGraph pain points and discuss further improvements that it will enable going forward.
