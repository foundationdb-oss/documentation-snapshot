Hotspot, are a source of problems for all databases. On FDB they can result in a system-wide performance degradation. This talk will demonstrate how SnowflakeDB, which uses FDB as its OLTP database, keeps track of FDB transactions and maps data to partitions on FDB storage nodes. The enables detection of hotspots, and discusses ways to handle them.
