This presentation will explain the role of FDB's storage engine component, how the storage engine's requirements are influenced by FDB's distributed architecture, and it will give a brief overview of the upcoming first storage engine to be designed with FDB's specific read and commit paths in mind.  In addition to higher write throughput, this new design will have a smaller space footprint via key prefix compression and a configurable ability to enable long running read transactions by trading off a reasonable amount of disk space to persist old data versions on disk.
