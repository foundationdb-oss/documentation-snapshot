FoundationDB's serialization library provides an abstraction that allows it to be replaced with a new serialization format without changing (much) client code. In this talk, Andrew will describe a flatbuffers implementation that is nearly a drop-in replace for the current serialization, and how it allows rolling upgrades and backward compatibility. Andrew will also describe how this might be tested in the simulator.
